Recently I saw a 0.3mp camera that changes any photo into practically pixelart, the only issue is that it costs 260€, and I have written this programm just to prove the overprice

### **Requrements**
to run the program, you need at least 
* `vscode` or some sort of code editor supporting python
* installed `PIL` with `pillow` fork

## **Usage** 
* download the file
* put the image you want to convert into the same folder as the file
* open the code, instructions are included in it

> [!TIP]
> to properly see the image, you need some sort of pixelart software (aseprite, etc.) or photoshop

> [!WARNING]
> The image that rogram is showing you is **not** the saved image, the saved one is in the same folder as the code named _output.png_
